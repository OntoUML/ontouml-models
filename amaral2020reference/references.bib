abstract="In recent years, there has been a growing interest, within the financial sector, in the adoption of ontology-based conceptual models to make the nature of conceptualizations explicit, as well as to safely establish the correct relations between them, thereby supporting semantic interoperability. Despite the wide number of efforts to create a unified view of the reality related to economic and financial domains, no comprehensive enough formal model has been developed to, on one hand, accurately describe the semantics regarding the world of money and currencies and, on the other hand, differentiate them from virtual currencies - of which cryptocurrencies are the most significant representative. This research aims at tackling these questions by conducting an ontological analysis of money and related concepts, grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology, based on a literature review of the most relevant economic theories, and considering recent innovations in the financial industry.",

abstract="Trust is a key component of relationships in social life. It is commonly argued that trust is the ``glue'' that holds families, societies, organizations and companies together. In the literature trust is frequently considered as a strategic asset for organizations. Having a clear understanding of the notion of trust and its components is paramount to both trust assessment and trust management. Although much progress has been made to clarify the ontological nature of trust, the term remains overloaded and there is not yet a shared or prevailing, and conceptually clear notion of trust. In this paper we address this issue by means of an in-depth ontological analysis of the notion of trust, grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology. As a result, we propose a concrete artifact, namely, the Reference Ontology for Trust, in which we characterize the general concept of trust and distinguish between two types of trust, namely, social trust and institution-based trust. We also represent the emergence of risk from trust relations. In addition, we make a comparative analysis of our Reference Ontology to other trust ontologies. To validate and demonstrate the contribution of our approach, we apply it to model two application examples.",
