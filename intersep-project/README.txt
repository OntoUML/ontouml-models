Complementary information sent by prof. Vitor Souza: "I sent the latest version from the project directory, but I don't know how up-to-date the model really is (I don't have Astah installed). The ontologies were made available publicly in the project's website (http://intersep.nemo.inf.ufes.br/index.php/ontologia/), one could check also that."
