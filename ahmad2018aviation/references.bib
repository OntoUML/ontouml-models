abstract="Using ontologies for enterprise data integration brings an opportunity to use them for efficient data query evaluation. The rationale is that ontologies represent common-sense structures that are reflected also in queries posed by data users and thus can be used for query optimization. This paper presents how proper foundational-ontology-based knowledge can be used to design a generic index, which can help in answering a wide range of queries compliant with the foundational ontology. We discuss several indexing techniques and evaluate our proposal for different UFO-based queries extracted from different query sets.",
