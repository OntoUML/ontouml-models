editorial-notes: The ontology is designed for a Dutch company in the PDEng trajectory of Tim van Ee (t.vanee@utwente.nl). As it is (currently) developed for the specific context of the company, its generalisability for the industry might be limited. 
The core of the ontology is based on the Building Product Ontology (BPO), the Ontology for Managing Ontologies (OMG), and several others of which the most prominent are indicated below. 
BPO - <https://w3id.org/bpo#>
Omg - <https://w3id.org/omg#>
Fog - <https://w3id.org/fog#>
Qudt - <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt#>
Schema - <http://schema.org#>
Seas - <https://w3id.org/seas#>
The ontology is still under development, any comments, suggestions or feedback is welcome!
