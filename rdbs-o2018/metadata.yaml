domain:
 - relational databases
 - database structure
library-classification: Class T - Technology
editorial-notes: The declared purpose of the ontology is "to identify and represent key concepts of the relational database domain in the architectural scope, not covering control and execution details." and "RDBS-O is being built in the context of a larger effort of building a network of ontologies on software development frameworks, in particular for object/relational frameworks [Bauer and King 2004]. Such ontologies will allow us to automate tasks such as migrating code from one framework to another or defining and detecting architectural smells in software projects".
