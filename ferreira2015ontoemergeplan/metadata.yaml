editorial-notes: The VP model was built over the XMI file provided in the URL presented below (see urls field). The complete model has more diagrams than the ones here modeled, however, just 9 of these were presented at the papers - these were the only ones that were re-modeled using VP. Some associations redefinitions and subsettings were not possible to be modeled because the related association end roles were not found.
