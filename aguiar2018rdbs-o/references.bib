abstract = {Relational database systems is a well-known domain and an essential component of life in modern society. However, a well-founded ontological conceptualization of this domain is not yet defined and shared by the community, nor applied as a solution to problems such as semantic interoperability, database migration, etc. In this paper, we present RDBS-O, a well-founded reference ontology on the relational database domain, rigorously constructed, verified and validated according to an ontology engineering method. In addition to a reference ontology, we also implement and test its operational version, using it to automatic instantiate the ontology from a real database sample.},
