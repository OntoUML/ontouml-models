editorial-notes: The models were imported to Visual Paradigm from a file generated from the last known version of the complete ontology, which was originally build on Enterprise Architect. After the importation, unused elements were removed and stereotypes fixed using the OntoUML plugin for Visual Paradigm. The diagrams were kept as they were, only with organization of relationships. Some notes for internal use were removed, but domain notes were kept. Essential and inseparable constraints were kept in the visualization, but the meta-properties were added to their corresponding compositions.
