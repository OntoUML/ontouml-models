abstract = {Non-functional requirements ({NFRs}) have been the focus of research in Requirements Engineering ({RE}) for more than 20 years. Despite this attention, their ontological nature is still an open question, thereby hampering efforts to develop concepts, tools and techniques for eliciting, modeling, and analyzing them, in order to produce a specification for a system-to-be. In this paper, we propose to treat {NFRs} as qualities, based on definitions of the {UFO} foundational ontology. Furthermore, based on these ontological definitions, we provide guidelines for distinguishing between non-functional and functional requirements, and sketch a syntax of a specification language that can be used for capturing {NFRs}.},
