abstract="This paper presents an ontology model of the IT architecture to corporations that aim to set up an architecture made to the service continuity. This model describe the IT components, the IT Service Continuity components and other entities, and the relationship between them. The article is based in two pillars: the internationals standards guiding the IT service continuity, specially the PAS 77:2006, and the Unified Foundation Ontology (UFO) in order to build a well-founded ontology. The ontology model is built using the Conceptual Model Language OntoUML with the objective of preserving the ontologic prerogatives defined in the UFO. At last, this paper will show an ontologic evaluation of the IT architecture described in the PAS 77:2006 standard.",
