Other part of the same model can be found in ahmad2016ontological, which was reproduced in diagram 2. The Safety Ontology is represented in diagram3. When a class' stereotype is not present in one diagram but can be found in another we represent it in both diagrams. Associations originally represented as bound were represented separated.";
