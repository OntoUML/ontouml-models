## NOTICE

The OntoUML model repository is currently being migrated to GitHub with the adoption of the [`ontouml-schema`](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-schema) JSON serialization for easy model processing.

If you wish to contribute to this initiative by submitting your ontology, please follow the instructions available in [our wiki](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontouml-models/wiki/How-to-Submit-a-Model). 

If you have any questions, please [create an issue](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontouml-models/issues) or contact [@claudenirmf](https://github.com/claudenirmf/).
