# OntoUML/UFO Catalog

The FAIR Model Catalog for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling Research, short-named **OntoUML/UFO Catalog**, is a structured and open-source catalog that contains OntoUML and UFO ontology models. This catalog was conceived to allow collaborative work and to be easily accessible to all its users.

Our goal with this catalog is to support empirical research in OntoUML and UFO, as well as for the general conceptual modeling area, by providing high-quality curated, structured, and machine-processable data on *why, where, and how* different modeling approaches are used.

The catalog offers a diverse collection of conceptual models, created by modelers with varying modeling skills, for a range of domains, and for different purposes. The ontology models are available in machine-readable formats (JSON and Turtle) and are accessible via permanent identifiers.

## Catalog structure

The whole catalog is hosted on a GitHub repository whose root directory contains: 

1. `catalog.ttl`: is the file encoding the catalog itself in a triple-based format - i.e., the aggregated data of all ontologies that are part of the catalog;
2. `metadata-catalog.ttl`: a Turtle file containing the catalog's metadata;
3. `metadata.ttl`: a Turtle file containing the catalog's metadata and the metadata from all its composing models;
4. list of folders - each one including all the information related to an OntoUML/UFO-based model.

We provide below a representation of the catalog directory tree:

```txt
/
|   catalog-metadata.ttl
|   catalog.ttl
|   metadata.ttl
+---ontology-1_folder/
|   |   metadata.ttl
|   |   metadata.yaml
|   |   ontology.json
|   |   ontology.ttl
|   |   ontology.vpp
|   |   references.bib
|   +---new diagrams/
|   |       diagram1.png
|   |       diagram2.png
|   +---original diagrams/
|           diagram1.png
|           diagram2.png
+---ontology-2_folder/
+---ontology-3_folder/
...
+---ontology-N_folder/
```

Each ontology folder is composed of the following files:

1. `ontology.vpp`: the Visual Paradigm project of the model; 
2. `ontology.json`: contains the JSON serialization of the model exported via the [ontouml-vp-plugin](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-vp-plugin);
3. `ontology.ttl`: uses the [OntoUML Metamodel in OWL](https://purl.org/ontouml-models/vocabulary) to map the model's data. This is a vocabulary designed to support the serialization and exchange of OntoUML models in compliance with the [ontouml-schema](https://purl.org/ontouml-schema), which is a specification of how to serialize OntoUML models as JSON objects. This file provides a specific URI for all data from the model. These URIs are generated according to the following template: `https://purl.org/ontouml-models/dataset/<folderName>`, and its publication allows anyone to access and manipulate all the model's instances;
4. `metadata.yaml`: contains the model's metadata;
5. `metadata.ttl`: is an rdf-based version in turtle syntax of metadata.yaml; 
6. `references.bib`: contains the BibTeX citation data for each publication about the model (this file is not required for unpublished models);
7. `original diagrams/`: is a folder containing images in PNG format of the diagrams created by the authors of the model;
8. `new diagrams/`: is a folder containing images in PNG format of all diagrams rebuilt on Visual Paradigm (keeping the names matching the original ones);

Note that the `.vpp`, the `.yaml`, and the `.bib` files are the ones provided by the collaborators. In contrast, the `.json` file is automatically generated for each model using the OntoUML [ontouml-vp-plugin](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-vp-plugin/). The `.png` files hosted in the `new diagrams/` folder are automatically generated by the catalog; the same for all the `.ttl` files.

### Metadata vocabularies

Following the practice of implementing [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), the OntoUML/UFO catalog schema (see image below) was built by using:
- [Data Catalog Vocabulary v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) (DCAT)
- [Dublin Core Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) (DCT)
- [Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) (SKOS)
- [Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication](https://www.isibang.ac.in/ns/mod/2.0/index-en.html) (MOD)
- [Friend of a Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) (FOAF)

![metamodel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8641647/165767408-b526fa70-efa1-4661-b752-bf910778320c.png)

Each semantic artifact itself is represented by a `dcat:Dataset`, described according to the `skos:Concept` category, and linked to a `dcat:Distribution` entity on which information such as `dcat:downloadURL` and `dcat:title` can be found.

### Catalog's persistent URLs

We created persistent URLs for the following resources:

- GitHub repository: https://purl.org/ontouml-models
- OntoUML vocabulary: https://purl.org/ontouml-models/vocabulary
- Aggregated data: https://purl.org/ontouml-models/catalog
- Ontology data: `https://purl.org/ontouml-models/dataset/<folderName>>`
