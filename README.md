# OntoUML Model Dataset for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling Research

The OntoUML Dataset is a curated open-source dataset of domain models designed with the OntoUML language. 

## Goal

Our goal with this dataset is two-fold:

1. **We want to support research on OntoUML.** This means providing high-quality data on how the language is used. This is paramount for the language's evolution and for the development of its engineering tools, such as transformations into codification languages and model evaluation techniques. 
2. **We want to support the OntoUML user community**. We want this dataset to be used by modelers who want to learn OntoUML and reuse existing models in their own projects. 

## How to contribute

We highly encourage authors to contribute with their models to this dataset.

If you wish to contribute to this initiative by submitting your ontology, please follow the instructions available in [our wiki](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontouml-models/wiki). 

If you have any questions about submitting new models or reusing those available in this dataset, please [create an issue](https://github.com/unibz-core/ontouml-models/issues).
