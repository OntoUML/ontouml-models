editorialNote: Comparing the diagrams from the original 2015 paper and from the "extended" 2017 version, precisely "Nephritic profile", there is one missing "is-a" between "Nephritic-Defining Albumin" and "Albumin". I considered that it was just a lost, so I kept it as in the original paper (since they were supposed to change the layout only). It was not possible to identify what the "Added" keyword in "Immune Response Event" is.
