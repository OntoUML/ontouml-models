abstract="Trust is a key component of relationships in social life. It is commonly argued that trust is the ``glue'' that holds families, societies, organizations and companies together. In the literature trust is frequently considered as a strategic asset for organizations. Having a clear understanding of the notion of trust and its components is paramount to both trust assessment and trust management. Although much progress has been made to clarify the ontological nature of trust, the term remains overloaded and there is not yet a shared or prevailing, and conceptually clear notion of trust. In this paper we address this issue by means of an in-depth ontological analysis of the notion of trust, grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology. As a result, we propose a concrete artifact, namely, the Reference Ontology for Trust, in which we characterize the general concept of trust and distinguish between two types of trust, namely, social trust and institution-based trust. We also represent the emergence of risk from trust relations. In addition, we make a comparative analysis of our Reference Ontology to other trust ontologies. To validate and demonstrate the contribution of our approach, we apply it to model two application examples.",

abstract="Trust is widely acknowledged as the cornerstone of relationships in social life. But what makes an agent trust a person, a resource or an organization? Which characteristics should a trustee have in order to be considered trustworthy? The importance of understanding trust in organizations has motivated us to investigate the representation of trust concerns in enterprise models. Based on a well-founded reference ontology of trust, we propose a pattern language for trust modeling in ArchiMate. We present a first iteration of the design cycle, which includes the development of the pattern language and its demonstration by means of a realistic case study about trust in a COVID-19 data repository.",

abstract="The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has made it possible to build systems that diagnose a patient, decide on a loan application, drive a car, or kill an adversary in combat. Such systems signal a new era where software-intensive systems perform tasks that were performed in the past only by humans because they require judgement that only humans possess. However, such systems need to be trusted by their users, in the same way that a lawyer, medical doctor, driver or soldier is trusted in performing the tasks she is trained for. This creates the need for a new class of requirements, Trustworthiness Requirements, that we have to study in order to develop techniques for their elicitation, analysis and operationalization. In this paper, we propose a foundation to develop such techniques. Our work is based on an Ontology of Trust that answers questions about the nature of trust and the factors that influence it. Based on the answers, we characterize the class of trustworthiness requirements. Among other things, this characterization supports the requirements engineer in defining thurstworthiness requirements, identifying the risks presented by the system-to-be, and understanding the signals the system must emit to gain and maintain trust.",
