immutable part and immutable whole were translated to readOnly

leftAtriumAsAPump and rightAtriumAsAPump specializations were corrected.


diagrams from two different papers

Fig1 from 2nd paper was not represented as it is part of ECG diagram
2nd paper user another notation, I kept CamelCase used in the 1st paper.

figs 2 and 3 modifies ECG model. I overwrited trying to eliminate possible inconsistencies. Original names were kept (e.g., ECGRecord, instead of Record)
