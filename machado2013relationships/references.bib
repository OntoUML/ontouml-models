  year      = {2014},
  abstract  = {The civil law system is highly characterized by relationships.
The general rule is that any document of this domain is always embed-
ded in a context of the legal order. The legal order can be deﬁned as
a set of norms; thus, understanding concepts of a legal norm is impor-
tant to understanding other legal norms. However, this feature impairs
knowledge of the law, since a thorough understanding of a norm requires
a speciﬁc knowledge for understanding the dependence between legal
norms. Considering the diﬃculty in undeciphering this knowledge, this
paper highlights the importance of modeling relationships between legal
norms in a civil law system. In the present paper, we propose an ontology
aiming to capture a clear, concise and unambiguous view of this domain,
as well as systematize and reveal the dependence between legal norms
with an emphasis on relationships existing in civil law. With such an
ontology, we expect to provide a shared understanding of the concepts
and relationships, enabling interoperability. Due to the complexity of the
domain, we developed a reference ontology written in OntoUML. In the
paper, we underline the major aspects of our ontology and emphasize its
potential application as a semantic reference for various civil law systems
in the world.},
