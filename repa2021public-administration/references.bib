abstract="Life events (life situations) are usually understood as a specific view on public administration activities which is close to their clients: citizens. This view usually helps to effectively and client-friendly organize the web platform of the public authority. However, the real meaning of life events is more essential. Such a view allows regarding the public administration activities as consequences of real events in real lives of the public administrations clients. This paper introduces an approach to the analysis of life situations in the context of life cycles of the public administration objects and the use of this approach in a real ongoing project. The relation of life events to the public administration processes as well as their relation to e-government are discussed and illustrated with examples from the project.",
