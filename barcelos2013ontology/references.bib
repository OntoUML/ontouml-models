abstract = {Normative Acts are important legislative and regulatory documents made by different governmental organs. Every year, a huge amount of information is provided in Normative Acts by these organs without control, i.e., there is no effective way to verify redundancies, inconsistencies, cross-impact and ambiguities. In this paper, we propose a domain ontology for Normative Acts based on official documents (the Brazilian Constitution and the Redaction Manual of the Presidency of the Republic) as a reference model that can be used to improve communication, interoperation and automation of Normative Acts. The reference model is built with a highly expressive well-founded language within a methodology that ensures its quality.},
