abstract = {With the rise of polyglot programming, different programming languages with different constructs have been combined in the same software development projects. However, to our knowledge, no axiomatization demonstrating the existential commitments of a language have been presented, nor is there effort to adopt a consensual conceptualization between languages, in particular object-oriented ones. In this paper, we propose {OOC-O}, a reference ontology on Object-Oriented Code whose purpose is to identify and represent the fundamental concepts present in OO source code. The ontology is based on UFO, was developed according to the SABiO method, verified according to its competency questions and validated by instantiation of concepts in OO code form and a process of harmonization among popular object-oriented languages.},
