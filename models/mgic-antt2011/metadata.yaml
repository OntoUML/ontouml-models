editorialNote: The models were imported to Visual Paradigm from a file generated from the last known version of the complete ontology, which was originally build on Enterprise Architect. After the importation, unused elements were removed and stereotypes fixed using the OntoUML plugin for Visual Paradigm. The diagrams were kept as they were, only with organization of relationships. Some notes for internal use were removed, but domain notes were kept. Essential and inseparable constraints were kept in the visualization, but the meta-properties were added to their corresponding compositions. Class Fiscal da ANTT 2 was merged to class Fiscal da ANTT, however Fiscal 2 was not merged to Fiscal because of their different stereotypes. The original diagrams were also generated from the same eap file, however, for these, nothing was done in order to correct the layout of the diagrams and importation problems may have happened. The main-source for this work does not describe the ontology itself, but the project in which the ontology was built.
