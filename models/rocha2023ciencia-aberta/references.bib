  abstract     = {Open Science involves the scientific practice that advocates for the open sharing of the entire research development process, including results, data, codes, among others. This summary presents an initial proposal for an Open Science ontology to organize knowledge and model this movement and its relationships. Using SABio as a technological input, and OntoUML in the design stage, the first steps towards the construction of Open Science ontological modeling were taken. The product is in its infancy and aims to expand the relations of the scientific world that urges freer access to research results, scientific data, and the construction of research.}
