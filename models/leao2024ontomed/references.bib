  abstract     = {This paper presents the results of a scientific initiation project aimed at developing a prototype to assist patients and caregivers in making informed decisions about the administration of prescribed or over-the-counter medications, without promoting self-medication. The project involves adapting an existing solution for verification of interaction among clinical recommendations, originally developed for healthcare professionals. Conceptual models in the OntoUML language are proposed to describe and clarify key concepts in the medical and pharmaceutical domains that need to be represented. Additionally, an implementation in Prolog is developed using Linked Open Data.}
