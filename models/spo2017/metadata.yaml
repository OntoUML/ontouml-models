editorialNote: The ontology was documented based on the version available at SEON website on 17 March 2022. This ontology was released in 1998, however, at that time, it was formalized in a language different than OntoUML. Because of that, the metadata issue field represents the first time this ontology was released specified in OntoUML. The source of the pre-OntoUML version is included in the metadata source field.
