	abstract     = {The use of object/relational mapping (ORM) frameworks is the state-of-practice in software development, with several ORM frameworks for different object-oriented programming languages. However, to our knowledge, there is no formal definition of the concepts related to these frameworks, which could serve as basis for semantic interoperability tasks (e.g., code migration) or in the definition of architectural smells independently of the chosen framework. In this work, we present ORM-O, a domain reference ontology that aims to identify and represent the semantics of object/relational mapping when such frameworks are used in software development.},
