	abstract     = {In recent years Brazil has assumed a set of commitments for improving its transparency, especially on the Public Budget. The resulting actions led to the availability of a large amount of public data from the federation, states and municipalities. However, there are still many challenges to deal with all this data in a unified way, seeking for more valuable information. This paper proposes an environment able to capture data from different government entities and store them in a common repository, based on a Public Expense Ontology, for providing uniform queries, regardless of the original data sources.},
