  abstract     = {Data plays a crucial role in contemporary organizational operations. The need to share information among entities in multinational contexts has led to the emergence of International Data Spaces as an option that promotes security, sovereignty, and trust in data exchange. However, several issues remain unclear in this context. A substantial gap is the absence of explicit business models that enable organizations to understand the value generated by data and the relationships among involved parties. The objective of this research was to develop a solution to derive and formalize business models for data sharing agreements in International Data Spaces. The adopted methodology was Design Science, applying the Systematic Approach for Building Ontologies as the main method to develop a domain reference ontology for International Data Spaces and a corresponding operational ontology. A practical demonstration of the ontology, using test data, resulted in the derivation of agreement models for data sharing in different ecosystem organizations. This ontology contributes by enabling organizations to formulate business strategies, understand how International Data Spaces function, and analyze data sharing agreements.}
