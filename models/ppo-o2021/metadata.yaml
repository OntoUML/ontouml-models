editorialNote: According to the authors, "the purpose of [PPO-O] is to identify and represent the concepts related to the preparation of "cured" raw data, that is, data significantly selected, more organized, easier to analyze and understand. The idea is to facilitate the generation of training and test data to be consumed by ML algorithms."
