	abstract     = {{Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a technological approach that emerged to meet the demands of seniors and people with disabilities. Because they are considered complex and multidisciplinary systems, it is necessary to identify and define which elements need to compose these systems. These challenges and the need for assistance in specifying requirements have led the academic community to explore and establish new approaches for the development of AAL systems. For this, there is the integration of different areas of knowledge, such as ontology, requirements engineering and compliance. Therefore, this work presents a central ontology to support the specification of requirements in AAL systems, where the elements that are part of the type of system are integrated. With the use of this ontology, it was possible to develop a domain ontology for vertical elevation platforms, where a validation was carried out with the industry in relation to the elements that constitute it and, later, a scenario was built to verify the syntactic correction of ontology. With the use of ontology, it will be possible to standardize the understanding of the associated terms and, at the same time, verify the relationships between the elements and help the designer in the requirements specification stage.}},
