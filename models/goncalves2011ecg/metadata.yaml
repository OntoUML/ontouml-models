editorialNote: For the meta-properties immutable part and immutable whole, the part and whole association end, respectively, were set as readOnly. LeftAtriumAsAPump and RightAtriumAsAPump specializations were corrected. Diagrams from different papers used different notations, for consistency, I converted all to upper camel case for classes and lower camel case for associations (used in the first source). Information presented in newer diagrams overwrites the ones in old diagrams. There is no information about packages for newer diagrams, so they were set in already existing packages according to their content. This model version is a conversion to OntoUML 2.0 of the previously published model.
