    ontouml:description "\"a person is just just in case all three parts of her soul are functioning as they should. Justice, then, requires the other virtues. So the unjust person fails to be moderate, or fails to be wise, or fails to be courageous. Actually, the relation among the virtues seems tighter than that, for it seems that the unjust person necessarily fails to be wise, courageous, and temperate... You might try to deny this. You might say that a person could be courageous�with spirited attitudes that track perfectly what the rational attitudes say is fearsome and not, in the face of any pleasures and pains�but still be unjust insofar has her rational attitudes are inadequately developed, failing to know what really is fearsome. But Socrates seems to balk at this possibility by contrasting the civically courageous whose spirit preserves law-inculcated beliefs about what is fearsome and not and the genuinely courageous in whom, presumably, spirit preserves knowledge about what is fearsome and not. So you might say instead that a person could be moderate�utterly without appetitive attitudes at odds with what his rational attitudes say is good for him�but still be unjust insofar as his rational attitudes are inadequately developed and fail to know what really is good. But this picture of a meek, but moderate soul seems to sell short the requirements of moderation, which are not merely that there be no insurrections in the soul but also that there be agreement that the rational attitudes should rule. This would seem to require that there actually be appetitive attitudes that are in agreement with the rational attitudes� conception of what is good, which would in turn require that the rational attitudes be sufficiently strong to have a developed conception of what is good. Moreover, it would seem to require that the rational attitudes which endorse ruling be ruling, which would in turn require that the rational attitudes are at least on the path toward determining what really is good for the person. If these considerations are correct, then the unjust are lacking in virtue tout court, whereas the just possess all of the virtues.\" (Brown)"@en;

    ontouml:description "Individual [human] soul is are made up of the residue (and an inferior grade) of the soul stuff of the universe, and are eventually embodied in physical bodies. This embodiment throws the previously regular motions of the soul into confusion as the soul is subjected to the forceful disturbances of internal bodily processes as well as the impact of external bodies upon it, particularly in sense experience. These disturbances gravely impair the soul�s cognitive functioning; only with appropriate nurture and education can its original motions be reestablished and proper cognitive functioning be restored. The body and its parts were designed to support that functioning, and Timaeus takes the design of the eyes and the mechanics of vision as an important case in point.� (Zeyl,Sattler)\n�But the arguments from conflict treat reason, spirit, and appetite as distinct subjects of psychological states and events, and it seems best to take Socrates� descriptions at face value unless there is compelling reason not to. At face value, Socrates offers a more robust conception of parts, wherein each part is like an independent agent. Indeed, this notion of parts is robust enough to make one wonder why reason, spirit, and appetite are parts at all, as opposed to three independent subjects. But the Republic proceeds as though every embodied human being has just one soul that comprises three parts. No embodied soul is perfectly unified: even the virtuous person, who makes her soul into a unity as much as she can, has three parts in her soul. (She must, as we shall see, in order to be just.) But every embodied soul enjoys an unearned unity: every human�s reason, spirit, and appetite constitute a single [human] soul that is the unified source of that human�s life and is a unified locus of responsibility for that human�s thoughts and actions.� (Brown)\n�every embodied human being has just one soul that comprises three parts.

A well-trained guardian will 'praise fine things, be pleased by them, receive them into his soul, and, being nurtured by them, become fine and good,' and each will 'rightly object to what is shameful, hating it while he�s still young and unable to grasp the reason'... Socrates has the young guardians not only responding to good things as honorable (with spirited attitudes), but also becoming fine and good.\" For auxiliaries military education is available. For producers there is primary education \"to make good on the commitment to promote especially talented children born among the producers and to enable the producers to recognize the virtue in the philosophers.\" (Brown)"@en;
