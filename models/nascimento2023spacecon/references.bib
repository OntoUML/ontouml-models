	abstract     = {Smart environments are one of the hot topics in the recent scientific literature in computer science. An essential aspect of these applications is how to obtain data about their users and understand them. Context-aware approaches proved to be successful in understanding these data. Therefore, user context representation is one of the problems to address in this domain. Context information can contain multidimensional information. This paper presents an ontology for representing context in smart environments called SpaceCOn. This ontology contains a definition of several context-related concepts. This ontology can be a strategic tool to integrate context data from different sources in large smart environments, such as smart universities and cities. Tests carried out in a case study demonstrated the developed ontology's potential.},
