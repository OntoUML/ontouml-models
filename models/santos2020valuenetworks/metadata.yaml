editorialNote: The author does not explicitly give a name to the ontology. In the original work, she refers to it by "Ontologia para Modelagem de Redes de Valor com Responsabilidade Corporativa", which I translated here to "Ontology for Value Networks with Corporate Responsibility". The diagram name was given by the author.
