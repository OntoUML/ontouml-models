  abstract = {This paper develops a domain ontology to enhance the digital twin for maritime logistics at the Twente canal. The research aims to improve operational efficiency, resilience, and stakeholder collaboration through a comprehensive ontological framework. The study employed a literature review and iterative model development using OntoUML. The main models created include the Domain Model, which maps the primary relationships within the Twente canal's logistics operations, and the Disruption and Digital Twin Models, which focus on contingency planning and technological integration, respectively. The outcomes demonstrate that the ontology can significantly enhance semantic interoperability and support proactive management strategies, promoting a robust digital twin implementation. Future work could focus on validating the ontology and working on the effective integration to ensure its practical applicability and scalability.},
