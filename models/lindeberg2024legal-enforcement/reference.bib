	abstract     = {Organisations are increasingly governed by complex and multilayered systems of rules and regulations. In heavily regulated sectors such as healthcare, compliance with these rules poses significant challenges. Not only can rule compliance conflict with organisational goals, but varying interpretations by enforcement actors can also lead to conflicting or unpredictable outcomes. Decisions by regulatory authorities and courts, equipped with fines and other sanctioning powers, create new institutional realities for organisations. One way to examine and understand these complex systems of rules and actors is through the use of ontologies. This paper aims to investigate how the UFO ontology, and, specifically, the legal core ontology UFO-L, can be used, or extended, for creating patterns for modelling of organisational rule enforcement. To facilitate this investigation, a legal case regarding Swedish healthcare was selected to identify requirements for an ontology for legal enforcement. These requirements were then compared with the representation capabilities of UFO-L. The investigation revealed strengths and weaknesses of UFO-L and provided suggestions for its modification.}
