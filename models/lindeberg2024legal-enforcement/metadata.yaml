editorialNote: This meta-model is originally composed of three distinct project files. To be included into the catalog, these projects were merged into a single one. The authors state that the projects include both slight adaptations of previous modelling efforts by other authors, and their own contributions representing how supervisory authorities and the court system enforces legislation.
