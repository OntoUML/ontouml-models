  title     = {Extending the Core Ontology on Decision Making according to Behavioral Economics},
  abstract  = {Decisions are constantly made and some of them may be extremely critical. However, most decision makers are unaware that their decisions may be biased. We used Behavioral Economics as a foundation to propose an ontology that shows how decision makers' preferences are set and the situation in which they occur in an intuitive decision under risk and uncertainty. Our aim is that this ontology be used to improve their decisions by allowing them a better understanding of how they decide. In addition, this ontology can be used as part of a strategy to reduce biases.},
